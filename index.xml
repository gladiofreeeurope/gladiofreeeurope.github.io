      <description>Letov: It’s punk rock, Russian punk rock. I wouldn’t even focus on the style, there are many different styles. We have a few projects, Kommunizm, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, and my own personal project. On the whole, it’s garage rock, garage punk.
Interviewer: Punk rock means you’re against something, right? That’s how it was in the West 10 years ago. Can you compare Western music with your own?</description>

      <title>Lyrics for Everything&#39;s Going According to Plan (1988)</title>

      <description>The key to our borders has been broken in two
And Our Father1 Lenin has withered away
He&amp;rsquo;s decomposed into mold and linden honey.
And the Perestroika is still going according to plan.
And the mud has turned into black ice, and everything is going according to plan.
And my destiny wants some rest.
I promised it not to join the game of war
But on my army cap, there is a hammer and a sickle and a star</description>

      <description>A rusty bunker - that’s my freedom
The sweet pastry has long ago dried up
With the boots of my people
The foremen hamper the shit
Hidden around the corner
Someone killed with a garbage can
The one who willingly descended into the basement
Doomed to failure from the start
I killed the government within me
Mute in a world of invective
Able to see in a world of empty eye sockets</description>

      <description>Sid Vicious died before your eyes
John Lennon died before your eyes
Jim Morrison died before your eyes
But you’ve stayed as you were&amp;hellip;
There are only two paths for honest fellows
Grab an automatic and kill everyone
Or kill yourself, yourself, yourself, yourself
If you earnestly perceive this world&amp;hellip;
The ends justify the means, let’s go Kill, rape, slander, betray For the sake of the light, light, light, light The bright building of the Juche idea</description>

      <description>Falling into ditches, smelling the stench of corpses
Solving the problems of global humanism
In circle after circle of darkness, communists march forward!
The source of objections packaged by the Sovdep1!
I will always be against this!
He who has not yet broken down, his time will come
Fill the rebel’s chest with bullets
Exhaustively delving into pro-Soviet bullshit
In a healthy state there shall be a healthy peace</description>

      <description>I see my motherland rising up from its knees
I see my motherland rising from the ashes
I hear my great motherland singing
My motherland is once more rising up from its knees
My epic nation is unbending its back
Our wrathful power is moving apart the walls
The sun calls us to follow it on campaign
Against deadly cold, against pitch-black night
I see my motherland rising up from its knees</description>
