    <a href="/letov/overabundance-of-wit/">Lyrics for Overabundance of Wit (1989)</a>
  </h3>
  
    <p>
      For an overabundance of wit, there&rsquo;s only beggars' bowls and prison
For a boistrous brain, there are only ditches and dikes For a beautiful brain, there are only scabs and lice For universal love there are only bloodied faces
A bedsheet blows in the wind, walking through morning dew From fruitless ideas to ethereal guests From closed doors to buried animals From covered tables to heads busted open

    <a href="/letov/my-defense/">Lyrics for My Defense (1989)</a>
  </h3>
  
    <p>
      The plastic world has won
The model turned out to be stronger
The last ship has gone cold
The last flashlight is tired
And clumps of memory are stuck in my throat
Oh - my defense
A glimmer of light in an unseeing world
Oh - my defense
A mournful little ball of an absurd world
A mournful little ball of a cheap world
The plastic world has won

    <a href="/letov/motherland/">Lyrics for Motherland (1993)</a>
  </h3>
  
    <p>
      I see my motherland rising up from its knees
I see my motherland rising from the ashes
I hear my great motherland singing
My motherland is once more rising up from its knees
My epic nation is unbending its back
Our wrathful power is moving apart the walls
The sun calls us to follow it on campaign
Against deadly cold, against pitch-black night
I see my motherland rising up from its knees

    <p>
      Corporal Schiklgruber1 wasn&rsquo;t in prison for naught
Corporal Schiklgruber wasn&rsquo;t in prison for naught
That&rsquo;s where he wrote Mein Kampf
That&rsquo;s where he wrote Mein Kampf
A textbook for sadists and exceptional bastards
A textbook for the strong, a textbook for Achilles
That&rsquo;s where he wrote Mein Kampf
Mein Kampf, Mein Kampf
Read Mein Kampf
Read Mein Kampf
Mein Kampf, Mein Kampf
Read Mein Kampf
Corporal Schiklgruber was a maniac and masochist

  </h3>
  
    <p>
      Falling into ditches, smelling the stench of corpses
Solving the problems of global communism
In circle after circle of darkness, communists march forward!
The source of objections packaged by the Sovdep1!
I will always be against this!
He who has not yet broken down, his time will come
Fill the rebel’s chest with bullets
Exhaustively delving into pro-Soviet bullshit
In a healthy state there shall be a healthy peace

    <a href="/letov/harakiri/">Lyrics for Harakiri (1988)</a>
  </h3>
  
    <p>
      Sid Vicious died before your eyes
John Lennon died before your eyes
Jim Morrison died before your eyes
But you’ve stayed as you were&hellip;
There are only two paths for honest fellows
Grab an automatic and kill everyone
Or kill yourself, yourself, yourself, yourself
If you earnestly perceive this world&hellip;
The ends justify the means, let’s go Kill, rape, slander, betray For the sake of the light, light, light, light The bright building of the Juche idea

    <a href="/letov/government/">Lyrics for Government (1988)</a>
  </h3>
  
    <p>
      A rusty bunker - that’s my freedom
The sweet pastry has long ago dried up
With the boots of my people
The foremen hamper the shit
Hidden around the corner
Someone killed with a garbage can
The one who willingly descended into the basement
Doomed to failure from the start
I killed the government within me
Mute in a world of invective
Able to see in a world of empty eye sockets

    <a href="/letov/everythings-going-according-to-plan/">Lyrics for Everything&#39;s Going According to Plan (1988)</a>
  </h3>
  
    <p>
      The key to our borders has been broken in two
And Our Father1 Lenin has withered away
He&rsquo;s decomposed into mold and linden honey.
And the Perestroika is still going according to plan.
And the mud has turned into black ice, and everything is going according to plan.
And my destiny wants some rest.
I promised it not to join the game of war
But on my army cap, there is a hammer and a sickle and a star

  </h3>
  
    <p>
      Here&rsquo;s everything that has been
It didn&rsquo;t exist nor does it now
All of the layers are soaked
All of the words have burned
Everything&rsquo;s as it should be1
In worn out boots
Years and cigarette buds
In worn out pockets
Passports and fingers
Everything&rsquo;s as it should be
Sprightly wheels
Durable buildings
New decrees
Brotherly graves
Everything&rsquo;s as it should be
Here&rsquo;s everything that has been

  </h3>
  
    <p>
      A fool wanders through the forest
Looking for a fool even greater than him
Death walks down the street, carrying blini1
on a plate Whoever takes one will have his fate
She&rsquo;ll touch him on the shoulder and kiss him passionately
And pennies will fly out of his ass
A fool wanders through the forest
Looking for a fool even greater than him
The gears are turning in my head

  </h3>
  
    <p>
      Lenin is Hitler, Lenin is Stalin
Lenin is Kim Il Sung, Lenin is Mao
Lenin is Buddha, Christ, and Cain and Abel
Lenin is the Yin and the Yang, Lenin is the Dao
Lenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will live
Lenin will, will, will
Lenin, Lenin he will live!
Lenin is the jokes with which they hound us
Lenin is the pastries with which they entice us

  </h3>
  
    <p>
      Letov: It’s punk rock, Russian punk rock. I wouldn’t even focus on the style, there are many different styles. We have a few projects, Kommunizm, Grazhdanskaya Oborona, and my own personal project. On the whole, it’s garage rock, garage punk.
Interviewer: Punk rock means you’re against something, right? That’s how it was in the West 10 years ago. Can you compare Western music to your own?
